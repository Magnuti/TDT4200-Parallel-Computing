# TDT4200 Parallel Computing

## Basic image manipulation
* Assignment 1 is just a basic introduction to the C programming language. We inverse, expand and rotate a BMP image.

## Image convolution
In these assignments we slide a filter/kernel over a BMP image.
* Assignment 3 uses **MPI** to parallelize the image convolution, with a border exchange scheme.
* Assignment 6 uses **CUDA** to parallelize the image convolution, with shared memory.

## Password cracker
In these assignments we parallelize a brute-force password cracker.
* Assignment 2 parallelizes with **MPI**.
* Assignment 4 parallelizes with **Pthreads** and **OpenMP**.
* Assignment 5 parallelizes with **CUDA**.
